# Infinite Universes: A Gitaverse Odyssey

In the year 2095, on the neon-lit streets of New Neo City, a mysterious figure named Zero received an encrypted message that would change the course of the universe forever.

Zero was in his office, pecking away on a keyboard. Zero wasn't his real name, but his pen name he used to publish some rather popular scifi novel series. His anonymity protected him from his overzelous fans, as discarded draft after draft of his sequel to his book. "Radioactive Decay 3: Portals of Regolith" was promised to his fans years ago, but he did not make any head way on it. As he unconsiously invent more excuses, the valve on his pneumatic tube hissed and plonked a fresh capsule into his office. It wasn't his usual sauce flooded cheeseburger that he ordered for lunch, but a single metal memory stick packed in foam.
